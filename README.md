This project tackles the complex problem of predicting house prices based on a diverse set of features. Using an advanced machine learning model, XGBoost Regressor, combined with robust data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA), the pipeline is designed to deliver accurate predictions while ensuring interpretability.

-> Features of the Project:

1. Data Preprocessing: 
- Handling Missing Values: Missing numerical features were imputed using the mean, while categorical features were filled with their mode.
- Column Dropping: Columns with a high percentage of missing values were removed to maintain data integrity.
- One-Hot Encoding: Transformed categorical features into binary variables for model compatibility.
- Duplicate Handling: Removed duplicate columns to ensure a clean dataset.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
-  Missing Values Visualization: Heatmaps provided a clear visual representation of missing data.
- Feature Engineering: Combined training and test datasets for consistent preprocessing.
- Data Distribution: Utilized Pandas and Seaborn to explore feature distributions and relationships.

3. Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning:
- XGBoost Regressor: Leveraged the power of Extreme Gradient Boosting for its efficiency and ability to handle diverse datasets.
- Grid Search with Cross-Validation: Optimized key hyperparameters (learning_rate, max_depth, n_estimators) to enhance model performance.

4. Evaluation and Results: 
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Used as the evaluation metric to measure model accuracy.
- Achieved a highly competitive RMSE on the validation set.
- Predictions on the test dataset were prepared and saved for Kaggle submission.

5. Visualization:
- Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to: Visualize missing data,  Analyze categorical distributions and relationships.
- Provided insights into data quality and feature importance.

6. Technical Highlights
- Languages and Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, XGBoost.
- File Handling: Efficiently read, preprocessed, and wrote large datasets using pandas.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Automated search for optimal parameters using GridSearchCV for performance maximization.
